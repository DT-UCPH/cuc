General:

Always check a word in DULAT for the lexeme. Are there homographs? DULAT adds roman numerals in parentheses to a lexeme for disambiguation. For now, we use this convention as well. Check also the part of speech.

lexemes of nouns and adjectives end on "/".
lexemes of verbs end on "[".


EXAMPLE:
Suppose in a text you find the word "il", meaning "God". DULAT adds "(I)" to it. This means that we encode the word as: il(I)/.


Pronominal suffixes are prefixed with "+".

Verbs with a double middle radical have ":d" at the end of the word.
Consonants that indicate the verbal stem are between ]]. E.g. a verb with a prefixed š (š-stem), looks like this: šqtl -> ]š]qtl[.
Verbal preformatives of the prefixkonjugation are between !!, e.g. tqtl -> !t!qtl[.

If a sign is part of a lexeme, but it does not appear in a word, it is added to the word prefixed by "(".
If a sign occurs in a word, but it does not occur in the lexeme in DULAT, it is preceded by "&".
