Tagging conventions updated

At this stage we decided not to reconstruct consonants, doubling, vowels and other grammatical markings that do not appear on the surface and concentrate on the visible elements. Altogether, if a sign is part of a lexeme, but it does not appear in a word, it is added to the word by "(". If a sign occurs in a word but it does not occur in the lexeme in DULAT, it is preceded by "&". E.g., in case of a scribal error corrected by editors, the ‘(’ precedes the ‘&’, as in wsp - (k&wsp “silver”. Otherwise, at this stage we don't reconstruct missing signs.
The signs ( and & are also can also be used for aleph letters (u, i, a).
Comments about variants can be added after  #

Lexical tagging: Always check a word in DULAT for the lexeme. Are there homographs? DULAT adds roman numerals in parentheses to a lexeme for disambiguation. For now, we use this convention as well. This rule applies also to the homographic particles, e.g. -h(I) pron "his/her" -h(II) adverb.
If aleph letters are part of the nominal root and do not show different variants of vocalization, they are not further parsed. In verbal roots aleph ʔ should be visible, because we follow the lexicon DULAT. E.g. the verb š-ʔ-b has the surface form šibt, we encode as š(ʔ&ib[/t= "those (fpl) who draw water".

Check also the part of speech.
lexemes of nouns and adjectives end on "/".
lexemes of verbs end on "[".
If a form is deverbal noun (as infinitive or participle), the order is [/.
Prepositions, particles, pronouns are without a special sign at the end.
E.g.: Suppose in a text you find the word "il", meaning "God". DULAT adds "(I)" to it. This means that we encode the word as: il(I)/.

Suffixes and enclitics:
Pronominal suffixes are prefixed with "+": mlk/+h "his king"
~ appears before the postclitic consonants: !y!rgm[~n "he says"
If feminine ending -t  of nouns (both sing or plur) is part of the lexeme, we leave it unmarked  at this stage. A noun that appears without the feminine -t in singular, but with -t in plural, e.g. gg, is tagged: gg/t= “roofs”. But adjectives and participles tag feminine ending -t, e.g. mru "fattened: the feminine singular form is mr(u&a/t and the feminine plural is mr(u&a/t=.
In III-ˀ nouns aleph letters show case endings, e.g. ksu "seat: ks(u/&u nominative, ks(u/&i genitive, ks(u/&a accusative; or plural of rpu "Rafa": rp(u&/m, rp(u&i/m.

Prefixes and infixes:
Verbal preformatives of the prefix conjugation are between !!, e.g. tqtl -> !t!qtl[.
Augment that indicates the verbal stem are between ]]. E.g. a verb with a prefixed š (š-stem), looks like this: šqtl -> ]š]qtl[.
An infinitive is encoded as !!qtl[/.
An active participle is encoded as qtl[/.
